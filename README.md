### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on different web apps and I plan on diving into cross-platform mobile development but, that will be when I get a **LAPTOP** with better **specification**.

- Iâ€™m currently learning how to write **efficient and scalable code**, improve on my **Data Structure and Algorithm skills**.
  I never stop learning but, i am stuck with PHP/Laravel for now.
  I see no reason to chase shiny technologies but i am open to learn anyone required for Job completion.
  Also, I am fast learner too.
